# Team Preggy
We are Team Preggy. Our project is about exploring mental health problems experienced by women during pregnancy and we are trying to achieve in promoting positive mental health in pregnant women through extensive exploration of the problem space. We aim to build a platform for pregnant women to share tips and advices to alleviate pregnancy-related symptoms. Also, we want to provide connections between gynaecologists and pregnant women by creating private message functions. The sharing of information and consulting the professionals through our application fulfil the social aspects that we aim to achieve through our design.
